A) Write a small pet project to get into coding again. You might want to use a language as Python which is also good for this Master! The Code can be relatively simple (as a simple game with console output).

B) Make sure each Person has applied the following topics on the code which have been taught in the lecture:

UML (at least 3 diagrams) ----- ESTO YA ESTA

Metrics (at least two. Sonarcube would be great) ------ REVISARLAS Y VER QUE SE PUEDE MEJORAR O DEJAR QUIETO

Clean Code Development (at least 5 points you can show me + 10 point cheat sheet) ---- ?!?!?!?

Build Management with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. (only travis is not enough) Do e.g. generate Docs, call tests, etc. ----- MAVEN

Integrate some nice Tests in your Code to be integrated in the Build ---- YA HAY TESTS 

Continous Delivery (show me your pipeline in e.g. Jenkins, Travis-CI, Circle-CI, etc.) ---- HAY QUE ARREGLAR ESTO PA EL MAC
 
Use a good IDE and get fluent with it as e.g. IntelliJ. What are your favourite Key-Shortcuts?! ---- INTELLIJ ... CUALES USAS TU?

DSL (Create a small DSL Demo example snippet in your code even if it does not contribute to your project) ---- FALTA ESTA JODA 

Functional Programming (prove that you have covered all functional definitions in your code as
only final data structures
(mostly) side effect free functions
the use of higher order functions
functions as parameters and return values
use clojures / anonymous functions



[DELETED / OPTIONAL] Show me an idea where to use a logical solver in your code and how you would do it!
[DELETED / OPTIONAL] Write a little code fragment (like data preparation etc.) in Scala or Clojure!
[DELETED / OPTIONAL] AOP (show me where you could have integrated AOP stuff => the jointpoints)
Please give me a hint as a checklist with one sentence for each 1-9 where I can find the info for points 1-9!!

The complete documentation must be found in the GitHub / GitLab doc e.g. ReadMe or Wiki. It should explain also B  in 1-2 paragraphs per point!

The contribution in Moodle is just a Link to GitHub in the comment section (@edlich)!!
