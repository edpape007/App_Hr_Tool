# Human Resource Tool

A small application to a human resource area.

## Description 

The objective of the application is that managers can write objectives to their employees and then qualify them.

Also that employees can give a qualitative qualification (a short description) of how their boss is towards them.

This is useful for human resources areas to obtain feedback from both the employee and their bosses and thus be able to make correction or improvement decisions.
